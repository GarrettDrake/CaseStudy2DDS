# CaseStudy2DDS
Project deliverables for Units 14-15 Case Study

This is a project examining a fake company, DDSAnalytics, that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. We have been tasked by DDSAnalytics executive leadership to  first predict employee turnover. Additionally we were tasked to predict the monthly income salary of workers from a hold out data set. K-NN, Naive Bayes, and multiple linear regression were used in the analysis and prediction.
